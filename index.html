    <p class="text">With a solid fan-base already in place, Dirty Heads are focusing their sights on something they’ve been edging towards for years: breaking the mainstream. “We want our fans to love it, because we love what we do and we want to keep doing it,” says Watson. “But this album for me, I cannot poke a hole in any of it. From front to back, it’s really so phenomenal. I’m so confident in it that I want it to take Dirty Heads from the band that we are in America, worldwide.”</p>
